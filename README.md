This repository contains my animation and diagrams on the equation a^n + b^n = c^n. 

In the diagram, a specific n is chosen and then we view both the **absolute solutions** (displays points which _exactly_ satisfy the equation),
but also the **continuous solutions**, where we colour each point based on how close ( a^n + b^n )  ^(1/n) is to an integer (0.5 = furthest, 0 or 1 = closest).
We look at all 4 quadrants in this diagram.

In the animation, we only focus on the 4th quadrant due to negative values resulting in complex results, which the program can't handle. 
We look at **only the continuous solutions**, since it's expected that for most values of n there will be no absolute solutions. 
We vary n over time according to some rate of change (defined in the program) and see how the graph gradually changes in appearance as a result. 

The idea is to gain some insight into how this graph looks visually - it forms some interesting patterns.
